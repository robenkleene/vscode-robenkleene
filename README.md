# Roben Kleene's Personal Visual Studio Code Extension

The idea of a personal extension is make a place for personal customizations to Visual Studio Code. Most programmable text editors have a built-in place to put customizations, like Vim's [`vimrc`](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Open_vimrc_file) and Emac's [`init.el`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html), but Visual Studio Code does not have this functionality; in order to make customizations, you must build an extension. But an extension is not an ideal way to manage personal customizations, especially not if shared via VSCode's [Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode).

## Foreword

The intention of sharing this extension is not for you to install it yourself, but instead to illustrate how a personal extension can be used to quickly add commands to VSCode, similar to how other programmable text editors can be customized. If you install this extension on your machine, most of the commands will not work, because most of the commands depend on [a number of other customizations](https://github.com/robenkleene/Dotfiles) already being in place. 

To those ends, the best way to peruse what customizations can do, and how they are added, is to look at the commands in the [`package.json`](package.json) file, and review how they are configured as contextual menus, keyboard shortcuts, and command palette commands.

## Making Your Own Personal VSCode Extension

This process illustrates how to make your own personal extension to extend VSCode and test your changes. The process is generally the same as you'd use when developing a normal extension for the Visual Studio Code Extension Marketplace, until you get to the last step about installing the extension.

1. **Creating a Personal Extension:** Create an extension with per [the official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).
2. **Editing Your Personal Extension:** Open your extension directory in Visual Studio Code, and hit `F5` (or select `Debug: Start Debugging` from the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)). This runs a separate instance of Visual Studio Code with your extension installed, so you can test your changes, to stop running the separate instance use `â‡§F5` (or `Debug: Stop` from the Command Palette).
3. **Install Your Personal Extension:** To install your extension, run the [`install script`](install.sh). This script just copies the extension files into your `~/.vscode/extensions/`, i.e., it installs the extension while bypassing the Extension Marketplace altogether. You should copy this script to your extension directory and run it from the command-line in that directory with `./install.sh`. Just running `./install.sh` will perform an `rsync` with the `--dry-run` flag enabled, so you can review what the script will do, assuming that output looks good, to actually install the extension use `./install.sh`.
